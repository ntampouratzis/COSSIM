Installation
------------

The CERTI build system is using CMake 
(http://www.cmake.org/HTML/RunningCMake.html) such that
you need to have a working CMake on your system in order to build CERTI.

Depending on the target platform (Windows, Linux, Solaris...) and
the compiler (GCC, Visual Studio, MinGW, ...) the CERTI CMake build
system should discover and require the needed dependency.

The fast (and hopefully easy) way to build CERTI is:

1) Get the CERTI tarball or zip from 
   http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/certi/
   
2) Unzip/Untar the archive
   This will create CERTI-X.Y.Z-Source/ directory
    
   on Unix this would be
   tar zxvf CERTI-X.Y.Z.tar.gz

3) Create a build directory
   Build_CERTI-X.Y.Z/
   mkdir Build_CERTI-X.Y.Z
   
4) Go to the build directory and launch CMake
   cd Build_CERTI-X.Y.Z
   cmake </path/to>/CERTI-X.Y.Z-Source
   
   may be
   cmake ../CERTI-X.Y.Z-Source
   
   one may choose the installation prefix with
   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install ../CERTI-X.Y.Z-Source
   
   or launch an interactive CMake UI in order to modify CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.
   cmake-gui ../CERTI-X.Y.Z-Source 
   or
   ccmake ../CERTI-X.Y.Z-Source
   
5) Build 
   make
   
6) Install 
   make install
   
The command used for building and installing CERTI depends
on the platform/compiler combination you chose. The previous
examples are for Unix-like system with make.
You may look at

   for other build examples.
