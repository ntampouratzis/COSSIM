#What is COSSIM?

COSSIM Simulation Framework is an open-source framework that efficiently integrate a series of sub-tools that model the computing devices of the processing nodes as well as the network(s) of the parallel systems. It provides cycle accurate results by simulating the actual application and system software executed on each node, realistic communication modeling of the different networks that are employed.

COSSIM is built on top of several well-established simulators: 

	GEM5, a state of the art full-system simulator, to simulate the digital components of each processing node in the simulated system

	OMNET++, which is an established network simulator, to simulate the real networking infrastructure

To bind the whole framework together, COSSIM employs the HLA architecture through the open-source CERTI package.
